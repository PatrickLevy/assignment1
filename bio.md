Hello, this is my bio page for assignment 1 of CS290 - Web Development.  When I'm not couunting in hexadecimal I enjoy bicycling, walks with my dog, camping, and music.  I am really looking forward to this class and am especially excited to start making interactive web applications!

I have been teaching high school science for over twelve years in St. Paul, Minnesota.  I started and am the head coach for our school's FIRST Robotics team.  While I love teaching I am ready for a change and am excited about an upcoming career in software development.

#Programming Background

I first dabbled in programming when I was in third grade on a Commodore 64.  While I have continued to play around with programming I did not start seriously studying it until I enrolled at OSU last summer.  My favorite project in CS165 was probably Conway's Game of Life.  Outside of school I have been working on learning basic web development and have been exploring the Meteor framwork for a possible internship at a local educational software company.

I am excited by the enhancements that technology can make to education.  While it is obvious that simply using technology in the classroom doesn't necessarily translate to greater student achievement, it also seems obvious that we should be attempting to leverage every possible tool at our disposal.
