Hello, this is my bio page for assignment 1 of CS290 - Web Development.  When I'm not couunting in hexadecimal I enjoy bicycling, walks with my dog, camping, and music.  I am really looking forward to this class and am especially excited to start making interactive web applications!

I have been teaching high school science for over twelve years in St. Paul, Minnesota.  I started and am the head coach for our school's FIRST Robotics team.  While I love teaching I am ready for a change and am excited about an upcoming career in software development.
