Hello, this is my bio page for assignment 1 of CS290 - Web Development.  When I'm not couunting in hexadecimal I enjoy bicycling, walks with my dog, camping, and music.  I am really looking forward to this class and am especially excited to start making interactive web applications!

I have been teaching high school science for over twelve years in St. Paul, Minnesota.  I started and am the head coach for our school's FIRST Robotics team.  While I love teaching I am ready for a change and am excited about an upcoming career in software development.

#Programming Background

I first dabbled in programming when I was in third grade on a Commodore 64.  While I have continued to play around with programming I did not start seriously studying it until I enrolled at OSU last summer.  My favorite project in CS165 was probably Conway's Game of Life.  outside of school I have been working on learning basic web development and have been exploring the Meteor framwork for a possible internship at a local educational software company.
